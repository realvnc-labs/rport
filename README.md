## Announcing the end of the RPort open source project  

**The RPort open source project has ended.**

Ongoing feature developments and product support for the open source solution has ended 2023-09-20. 

Having Rport as proprietary software will enable us to better invest in the product’s development, allowing us to bring users
more features to market quicker, deliver quality customer support, and improve ongoing product reliability and resilience. 

The first proprietary version of the software will be v.1.0, due for release in October 2023. Already, the release will deliver two highly-requested features when it launches: 

* NEW: Alerts will be introduced for proactive device monitoring to help identify and address device issues before they become full-fledged business problems. 
* NEW: Granular user permissions will offer fine-tuned control over user access to executable commands as well as to which remote access methods can be used.
